	Course:		CS2130 DSA Lab 
	Semester:	2024 Jan-Apr
	Lab:		04 | Set ADT on Sorted Link List Data Structure
	Task Set 1:	Sorted Link List Data Structures

	Aim: 		Implement a sorted linked list with some basic functions.
	Assume:		All data to be stored are integers

	Notes: 		
	The sorted linked list data structure is a singly linked list which
	always keeps its elements in a non-decreasing sorted order.
	
	Please note the following comparisons between ordinary LL and sorted LL

	1.	While an ordinary LL may have separate insert_at_start() and
		insert_at_pos() functions, a sorted LL will only have one insert()
		function, which determines the position of insert based on the data.
		The other two functions should NOT be implemented. They will spoil the
		sorted nature of the list.
		
		Implementing this insert() will be your Task 1.

	2.	While delete_at_start() and delete_at_pos() will not affect the sorted
		nature of the list, what is more useful is to have a single delete
		funciton which will search fot the first occurence of a data and delete
		it from the list. 
	
		Implementing this delete() will be your Task 2.

	3.	While get_from_start() and get_from_pos() are also harmless. They do
		not serve much of a purpose and hence need not be implemented. The most
		commonly used funciton to read the list will be find().
